                    UIViewController is the most basic class to develop a screen of the app.<br />
                    Actually the class ending with ViewController provides the functions and controls to work as a screen.<br />
                    UIKit has some classed ending with ViewController such as
                </Typography>
                <Typography className={style.textColor} variant="h5">UITableViewController</Typography>
                <Typography className={style.textColor} paragraph>Used to develop a screen designated for list view</Typography>
                <Typography className={style.textColor} variant="h5">UICollectionViewController</Typography>
                <Typography className={style.textColor} paragraph>Used to develop a screen designated for grid view</Typography>
                <Typography className={style.textColor} paragraph>Also the classes ending with Controller has function to connect the ViewControllers.<br />
                    You can learn this later.</Typography>
                <Typography className={style.textColor} paragraph>Ok,then let's learn UIViewController.<br />
                    â€»Note that the things we are going to do is just one of the way to develop. If you have enough knowledge and prefers another way, you don't have to follow this way.</Typography>
                <Typography className={style.textColor} paragraph>First, open the ViewController.swift. If you came across the first session, it's file should look like this<br />
                    <img src={vcImg} width={"60%"} height={"40%"} alt="" /><br />
                    The ViewController at this stage has only little bit of code after the project is created.<br />
                    So, let's look in to it.
                </Typography>
                <Typography className={style.textColor} paragraph>import UIKit<br />
                    Importing required library</Typography>
                <Typography className={style.textColor} paragraph>class ViewController: UIViewController<br />
                    Creating the class called "ViewController" extending "UIViewController"</Typography>
                <Typography className={style.textColor} paragraph>override func viewDidLoad()<br />
                    Called when the class is created. This is a function of lifecycle and commonly used to setup the stuffs here</Typography>
                <Typography className={style.textColor} paragraph>If you run the project now, it should show the blank screen. Because we haven't setting up anything.</Typography>
            </div>
